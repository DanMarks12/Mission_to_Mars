# Mission_to_Mars

The purpose of this project was to create an app (that works on mobile as well) that is able to scrape high resoultion images from Nasa website using live data. In the module we scraped a picture of NASAs: Mars featured image as well as a fact sheet from their website. In the challenge we went on to scrape the 4 hemispheres of mars, then updated it to show at the bottom of our app with their images and titles. Finally we added bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.
